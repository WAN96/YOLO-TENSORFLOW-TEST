# YOLO-TENSORFLOW-TEST

This is a simple test on YOLO, I build the net work by referencing https://github.com/CharlesShang/TFFRCNN and https://github.com/hizhangp/yolo_tensorflow

tensorflow 1.2
python 3.5
opencv
KITTI databse

I use KITTI dataset to train this network
Before training, I change the dataset format into voc vesrion by using the code from  https://github.com/CharlesShang/TFFRCNN
